# Creating Icons for Chrome Extension

Your Chrome extension needs the following icon files in the `icons/` directory:

- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels) 
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Quick Solution:
You can create simple colored squares as placeholders:

1. Open any image editor (even MS Paint or Preview on Mac)
2. Create a 128x128 pixel image with a solid color (e.g., blue)
3. Add white text "KP" in the center
4. Save as `icon128.png`
5. Resize to 48x48 and save as `icon48.png`
6. Resize to 16x16 and save as `icon16.png`

## Alternative:
Use an online icon generator like:
- https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
- https://www.iconarchive.com/

## Or use emoji as icons:
Many developers use emoji as quick placeholder icons during development.

Once you have created the icons, place them in the `icons/` directory and your extension will be ready to load!
