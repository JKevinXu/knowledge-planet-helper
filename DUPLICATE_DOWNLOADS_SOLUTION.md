# Solving Duplicate Downloads in Browser Extensions: A Case Study

## The Problem 🚨

Our Knowledge Planet PDF Downloader extension was experiencing a critical issue: **duplicate downloads**. Users would click a download button once, but the same PDF would be downloaded multiple times, creating confusion and wasting bandwidth. This issue was particularly problematic when using the batch download feature, where a single PDF could be queued for download several times simultaneously.

## Root Cause Analysis 🔍

After diving deep into the codebase, we identified several factors contributing to duplicate downloads:

### 1. **Race Conditions Between Scripts**

```typescript
// Background script and content script messaging overlapping
chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener((request, sender, sendResponse) => {
  if (request.action === 'downloadPDF') {
    handlePDFDownload(request, sender, sendResponse);
  }
});
```

Multiple rapid user interactions could trigger simultaneous download requests before the first request had time to register and prevent subsequent duplicates.

### 2. **Weak Hash Function**

```typescript
// Original weak hash implementation
function createDownloadHash(fileName: string, downloadCount: number, uploadDate: string): string {
  const input = `${fileName.trim()}_${downloadCount}_${uploadDate.trim()}`;
  let hash = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
    const char = input.charCodeAt(i);
    hash = ((hash << 5) - hash) + char; // Prone to collisions
    hash = hash & hash;
  }
  return Math.abs(hash).toString(16);
}
```

The simple hash function was prone to collisions, especially for files with similar names or metadata.

### 3. **UI State Management Issues**

```typescript
// Button not immediately disabled, allowing multiple clicks
target.setAttribute('disabled', 'true');
target.textContent = '🔄';
```

Brief delays in UI updates allowed users to click download buttons multiple times before they were visually disabled.

### 4. **Dynamic Content Reordering**

```typescript
// PDF elements could change order during scanning
const allPDFs = detectPDFFiles();
let targetElement: HTMLElement | undefined = allPDFs[task.pdfIndex];
```

The dynamic nature of the webpage meant PDF elements could reorder themselves, causing index-based selection to target the wrong files or the same file multiple times.

## The Solution Strategy 🛠️

We implemented a **multi-layered defense strategy** to eliminate duplicates:

### Layer 1: Enhanced Hash Algorithm

```typescript
function createDownloadHash(fileName: string, downloadCount: number, uploadDate: string): string {
  // More robust hash function using djb2 algorithm
  const input = `${fileName.trim()}_${downloadCount}_${uploadDate.trim()}`;
  let hash = 5381; // djb2 algorithm initial value
  
  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
    hash = ((hash << 5) + hash) + input.charCodeAt(i); // hash * 33 + char
  }
  
  return Math.abs(hash).toString(16);
}
```

**Improvement**: Replaced the weak hash with the proven **djb2 algorithm**, significantly reducing collision probability.

### Layer 2: Secondary Verification System

```typescript
function createSecondaryKey(fileName: string, fileSize?: number): string {
  const sizeComponent = fileSize ? `_${fileSize}` : '';
  return `${fileName.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '_')}${sizeComponent}`;
}

// Enhanced duplicate detection with multiple verification layers
let processedFileNames: Set<string> = new Set();
```

**Improvement**: Added a **filename-based secondary key** system as a backup verification layer.

### Layer 3: Early Detection at Registration

```typescript
// CHECK FOR DUPLICATES EARLY - before download starts (multiple layers)
const secondaryKey = createSecondaryKey(fileName);

if (processedDownloads.has(hashKey)) {
  console.log(`⚠️ Duplicate download detected by hash, skipping: ${fileName}`);
  sendResponse({ success: false, message: 'Duplicate download prevented (hash match)' });
  return;
}

if (processedFileNames.has(secondaryKey)) {
  console.log(`⚠️ Duplicate download detected by filename, skipping: ${fileName}`);
  sendResponse({ success: false, message: 'Duplicate download prevented (filename match)' });
  return;
}

// Mark as processed immediately to prevent race conditions
processedDownloads.add(hashKey);
processedFileNames.add(secondaryKey);
```

**Improvement**: Implemented **early duplicate detection** during the registration phase, before any download actually begins.

### Layer 4: Sequential Download Queue

```typescript
class DownloadQueue {
  private queue: DownloadTask[] = [];
  private isProcessing = false;
  private maxRetries = 2;
  private downloadDelay = 3000; // 3 seconds between downloads

  private async process() {
    if (this.isProcessing || this.queue.length === 0) return;
    
    this.isProcessing = true;
    // Process one download at a time with delays
    while (this.queue.length > 0) {
      const task = this.queue.shift()!;
      await this.downloadSinglePDF(task);
      
      if (this.queue.length > 0) {
        await this.delay(this.downloadDelay);
      }
    }
    this.isProcessing = false;
  }
}
```

**Improvement**: Replaced concurrent downloads with a **sequential queue system** that processes one download at a time with controlled delays.

### Layer 5: Batch Download Deduplication

```typescript
// Remove duplicates by filename to prevent same PDF being downloaded twice
const uniquePDFList = selectedPDFList.filter((pdf, index, array) => {
  const firstOccurrence = array.findIndex(p => p.fileName === pdf.fileName);
  if (firstOccurrence !== index) {
    console.warn(`🚫 Skipping duplicate PDF: "${pdf.fileName}" (index: ${pdf.index})`);
    return false;
  }
  return true;
});
```

**Improvement**: Added **client-side deduplication** for batch operations, filtering out duplicates before they enter the download queue.

### Layer 6: Ongoing Download Tracking

```typescript
let ongoingDownloads: Set<string> = new Set();

// Check if already downloading
const downloadKey = `${task.expectedFileName}_${task.downloadCount}`;
if (ongoingDownloads.has(downloadKey)) {
  console.log(`⚠️ Download already in progress, skipping: ${task.expectedFileName}`);
  return true; // Consider this a success to avoid retry
}

ongoingDownloads.add(downloadKey);
```

**Improvement**: Maintained a **runtime tracking system** to prevent concurrent downloads of the same file.

### Layer 7: Automatic Cleanup

```typescript
// Clean up old pending downloads and processed downloads periodically
setInterval(() => {
  if (pendingDownloads.size > 0) {
    console.log(`🧹 Cleaning up ${pendingDownloads.size} pending downloads`);
    pendingDownloads.clear();
  }
  if (processedDownloads.size > 0) {
    console.log(`🧹 Cleaning up ${processedDownloads.size} processed downloads`);
    processedDownloads.clear();
  }
  if (processedFileNames.size > 0) {
    console.log(`🧹 Cleaning up ${processedFileNames.size} processed filenames`);
    processedFileNames.clear();
  }
}, 60000); // Clean up every minute
```

**Improvement**: Added **automatic cleanup** to prevent memory leaks and reset tracking state periodically.

## Key Takeaways 💡

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple verification layers are more effective than relying on a single solution
2. **Early Detection**: Catch duplicates at registration time rather than during execution
3. **Queue Management**: Sequential processing with delays prevents race conditions
4. **Hash Algorithm Choice**: Use proven algorithms (djb2) instead of simple implementations
5. **User Feedback**: Immediate UI updates and clear messaging improve user experience
6. **Memory Management**: Regular cleanup prevents resource leaks in long-running extensions
7. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging helps debug issues in production

## Best Practices for Browser Extensions

### ✅ Do's
- Implement multiple verification layers
- Use proven hash algorithms

## Testing Strategy

We tested the solution across multiple scenarios:

1. **Rapid clicking** - Multiple quick clicks on same download button
2. **Batch operations** - Selecting multiple PDFs including duplicates
3. **Network delays** - Slow connections causing timing issues
4. **Dynamic content** - Page content changing during operation
5. **Memory stress** - Long-running sessions with many downloads
6. **Error scenarios** - Network failures and recovery
